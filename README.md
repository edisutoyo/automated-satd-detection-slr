##### Authors: Edi Sutoyo, Andrea Capiluppi

## Description of this study:
Technical debt (TD) is a well-known metaphor for the long-term effects of architectural decisions in software development and the trade-off between producing high-quality, effective, and efficient code and meeting a release schedule. Thus, the code degrades and needs refactoring. A lack of resources, time, knowledge, or experience on the development team might cause TD in any software development project. In the context of TD detection, natural language processing (NLP) has been utilized to identify the presence of TD automatically and even recognize specific types of TD. However, the enormous variety of feature extraction approaches and algorithms employed in the literature often hinders researchers from trying to improve their performance. In light of this, this systematic literature review proposes a taxonomy of feature extraction techniques, and machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) algorithms used in technical debt detection: its objective is to compare and benchmark their performance in the examined studies. We selected 53 articles that passed the quality evaluation of the systematic review. We then investigated in depth which feature extractions, and algorithms were employed to identify technical debt in each software development activity. All approaches proposed in the analyzed studies were grouped into NLP, NLP+ML, and NLP+DL. This allows us to discuss the performance in three different ways. Overall, the NLP+DL group consistently outperforms in precision and F1-score for all projects, and in all but one project for the recall metric. Regarding the feature extraction techniques, the pre-trained word embeddings (PTWE) consistently achieve higher precision, recall, and F1-score for each project analyzed. Furthermore, TD types have been mapped, when possible, to software development activity: this served to determine the best-performing feature extractions and algorithms for each development activity. Finally, based on the review results, we also identify implications that could be of concern to researchers and practitioners.
